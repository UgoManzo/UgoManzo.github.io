    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Ugo and Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at the University of Salerno. Iâ€™ve always been curious about technology:
        I learned to use a computer before I even knew how to write. After high school, I took some time to reflect on my path, and that break helped me understand what I truly wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I rediscovered computer science with a new mindset and fell in love with it again. What once seemed scary now inspires me. I study with genuine interest,
        and I enjoy solving problems not just to make things work, but to understand them deeply and explain them clearly.
